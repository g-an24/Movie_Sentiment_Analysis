# Movie Sentiment Analysis

A beginner-level NLP project to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, helping me learn the basics of Natural Language Processing.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify movie reviews using NLP techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Dataset**: IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset (50,000 labeled reviews).

## To-Dos Completed

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converted text to lowercase.
   - Removed punctuation and stopwords.
   - Tokenized the text.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Used `CountVectorizer` to convert text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
   - Evaluated the model's accuracy.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

- Basics of text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Implementing a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
